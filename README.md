Project: “Games Week”

In the 4th week of Bootcamp, we had the Games Week, where each team of 5 people had to develop a game in 10 days, but only outside class hours.

We started by spending the first day doing a brainstorm to decide what the game would be about, the minimum viable product (MVP), and the next features to in implement if we had the time.

We divide tasks and use Agile development methodologies as SCRUM along the process to keep track of the progression and to make decisions.

Our game was developed applying the OOP principles and using  Java and a “simple graphics” library created by the Academia de Código that didn’t have many built-in methods that could make ours work easier, so we had to develop everything by ourselves. 

This was my first team programming project, and it went very well. It was a fantastic experience and allowed me to grow a lot in programming skills and teamwork.
